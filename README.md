# Sorts
Sorting algorithms 
This is a collection of popular sorting algorithms (Bubble, Merge, Heap, Quick) that I have implemented during
my time as a student at California State University of Bakersfield. Each aspect of the Sorts that make them
unique is implemented from the split of the Merge Sort to the pivot of the Quick Sort.
PREREQUISITES
There are no prerequisites for installing this project.
INSTALLING
To install, clone the project onto your desktop, or wherever you wish to have it stored. 
RUNTIME
Each Sort runs thoroughly and performs perfectly. In most files, the array of numbers is generated randomly. The user
is shown a "Before & After" for the Array to show that the list of numbers is sorted correctly.
